Issue: Null Pointer Dereference
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_cs.c
Function: amdgpu_cs_parser_init
Line: 51

Description:
The function 'amdgpu_cs_parser_init' dereferences 'cs' without first checking if it is NULL. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if 'cs' is NULL when the function is called.
Code Path:

Function 'amdgpu_cs_parser_init' is called with 'cs' as an argument
'cs' is dereferenced at line 51 without a NULL check: if (cs->in.num_chunks == 0)

The function sprintf is used to write to the buffer stmp without any length checking. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the formatted string exceeds the size of stmp.

The function amdgpu_cs_pass1 allocates memory for chunk_array using kvmalloc_array(). However, if an error occurs after this allocation but before the function successfully completes, the allocated memory may not be freed, resulting in a resource leak.

A potential buffer overflow has been detected in the function gfx_v9_4_2_log_wave_assignment().
