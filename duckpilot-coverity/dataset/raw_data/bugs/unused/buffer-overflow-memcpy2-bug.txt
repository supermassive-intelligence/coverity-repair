Issue Type: BUFFER_OVERFLOW
Severity: High
CID: BUFFER_OVERFLOW_MEMCPY
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_ras_eeprom.c
Status: New
Impact: High
Line: 506

Description
Buffer overflow in __encode_table_record_to_buf() due to unchecked buffer boundaries before memory operations. The function performs multiple sequential writes to a buffer without size validation, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
Technical Details

Function receives unconstrained buffer pointer
No size parameter is provided
Multiple memcpy operations performed without bounds checking
Total write operations exceed potential buffer size
No error handling for buffer overflow conditions

Risk

Memory Corruption: Potential to write beyond buffer boundaries
System Stability: May cause system crashes or undefined behavior
Security: Could be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

Fix Recommendations:
Verify remaining space before each memcpy.
