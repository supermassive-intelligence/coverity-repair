Type: Integer Overflow
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_bios.c
Function: amdgpu_read_bios_from_rom
Line: 177

Description:
An integer overflow vulnerability has been detected in the function amdgpu_read_bios_from_rom. 
The issue occurs when calculating the length of the BIOS to be allocated. 
The function uses the AMD_VBIOS_LENGTH macro to determine the initial length, then aligns it to 4 bytes using the ALIGN macro. 
This sequence of operations could potentially lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller allocation than intended and possible buffer overflow when reading the BIOS.
