Description
Buffer overflow in __encode_table_record_to_buf() due to unchecked buffer boundaries before memory operations. 
The function performs write to a buffer without size validation, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access.

-> Function: __encode_table_record_to_buf
    memcpy(buf + i, &tmp, 6)
   * No buffer size validation before memory operation

Events

Function receives unconstrained buffer pointer
No size parameter is provided
Multiple memcpy operations performed without bounds checking
Total write operations exceed potential buffer size
No error handling for buffer overflow conditions
