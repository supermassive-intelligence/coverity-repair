Description: Potential buffer overflow in memcpy() operation
In amdgpu_atif_verify_interface, the size of the data to copy is read from info->buffer.pointer and directly used in a memcpy. If size of input->buffer.pointer exceeds the destination buffer (output), it can cause a buffer overflow. Before memcpy, add a check to ensure that output buffer is less than input->buffer.pointer.
