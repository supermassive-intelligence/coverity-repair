Issue: Potential Buffer Overflow

CID: 1002
Severity: High
Type: Security
Category: Buffer Overflow
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_atombios.c
Function: amdgpu_atombios_copy_swap
Line: 1630

Description:
A potential buffer overflow vulnerability exists because the code performs a memcpy operation without verifying if the num_bytes parameter exceeds the allocated size of the src_tmp buffer. When num_bytes is larger than src_tmp's capacity, the memcpy will write beyond the buffer's bounds.
