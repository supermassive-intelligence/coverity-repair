Issue: Resource Leak
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_cs.c
Function: amdgpu_cs_pass1
Line: 218

Description:
A memory resource allocated using kvmalloc_array() may not be freed if an error occurs during execution.
The function amdgpu_cs_pass1 allocates memory for chunk_array using kvmalloc_array(). 
However, if an error occurs after this allocation but before the function successfully completes, the allocated memory may not be freed, resulting in a resource leak.
