Problem:
Unbounded string operation using sprintf can cause buffer overflow

Abstract:
The code uses sprintf to write to buffer 'hid' without size checking. The sprintf 
operation could write beyond the buffer boundaries if the formatted output string 
exceeds the destination buffer size. This could corrupt adjacent memory and lead 
to system instability or security vulnerabilities.

Details:
The sprintf function is used to format a string containing "AMD" concatenated with 
a number. Since sprintf performs no bounds checking, if AMD_XCC_HID_START + id 
produces a large number, the resulting string could overflow the fixed-size 'hid' 
buffer. This occurs in the GPU driver's ACPI enumeration code which runs with 
kernel privileges.

Fix:
Replace sprintf with snprintf and specify the buffer size:
  snprintf(hid, sizeof(hid), "%s%d", "AMD", AMD_XCC_HID_START + id)
