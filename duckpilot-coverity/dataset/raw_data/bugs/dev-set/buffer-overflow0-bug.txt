Issue: Lack of Boundary Checks
Type: BUFFER_OVERFLOW
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/vi.c
Line: 659

Description:
The function vi_read_bios_from_rom lacks proper boundary checks when reading data into the bios buffer. 
The function calculates the number of dwords to read based on the input length_bytes, but it doesn't verify 
if this calculated length exceeds the actual allocated size of the bios buffer. 
This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing memory corruption or security vulnerabilities.
