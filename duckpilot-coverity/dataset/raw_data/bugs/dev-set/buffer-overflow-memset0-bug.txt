Issue: Potential Buffer Overflow
Type: Buffer Overflow

Description:
A potential buffer overflow has been detected in the function gfx_v9_4_2_wait_for_waves_assigned(). 
The function uses a fixed-size buffer of 256 bytes to store a formatted string, but does not implement proper bounds checking. 
The size of the string written to str depends on the values of constants CU_ID_MAX, SIMD_ID_MAX, and WAVE_ID_MAX, which are not taken 
into account when determining the buffer size. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the accumulated string length exceeds the allocated buffer size.
