Issue: Potential Buffer Overflow

CID: 1024
Severity: High
Type: Security
Category: Buffer Overflow
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/atombios_dp.c
Function: amdgpu_atombios_dp_get_dpcd
Line: 359

Description:
A potential buffer overflow vulnerability was present in the function amdgpu_atombios_dp_get_dpcd.
The issue arises from the call to memcpy(dig_connector->dpcd, msg, DP_DPCD_SIZE);, 
where the size of DP_DPCD_SIZE is not validated against the size of the destination buffer dig_connector->dpcd. 
If DP_DPCD_SIZE exceeds the size of dig_connector->dpcd, it could result in memory corruption.
