Problem: 
Unbounded string copy when initializing VCN decoder ring name using sprintf

Abstract:
The code uses sprintf to write a fixed string into ring->name without size checking. 
Additionally, there appears to be a syntax error in the fix attempt, as the sizeof 
parameter is malformed. This could potentially overflow the destination buffer and 
corrupt adjacent memory.

Path:
 drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/vcn_v2_0.c:169
   sprintf(ring->name, "vcn_dec")

Details:
The VCN decoder ring initialization code copies a hardcoded string "vcn_dec" into 
the ring name buffer using sprintf without verifying the buffer size. While the 
source string is constant in this case, using unbounded string operations in 
kernel code is risky. Additionally, the attempted fix contains a syntax error in 
the sizeof usage.

Fix:
Replace with properly formatted snprintf call:
 snprintf(ring->name, sizeof(ring->name), "vcn_dec")
